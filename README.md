Iâ€™m currently working on:
-  Working as an iOS Developer, mainly using Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Open-CV, PyTorch, CoreML and some Objective-C. Creating an application for patients and doctors to upload and check images of their skin. Skin images are processed with Open-CV before being fed to on-device ML models with either PyTorch or CoreML.

Previous Projects:
-  [Joy v2](https://github.com/wanony-bros/Joy), a discord chat bot built with Kotlin, Java and the [JDA library](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA).
-  [MikaTalk](https://github.com/wanony/mikatalk), a MERN stack AI chat site for [Mika](https://bluearchive.fandom.com/wiki/Misono_Mika) from the video game [Blue Archive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com/home). WIP using open-source LLMs for chat generation. Not deployed.
-  [Joy](https://github.com/wanony/JoyBot), an open source discord bot using the [nextcord](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord) library and MySQL/MariaDB.
- [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) based project that was related to my final year university project. Utilised many of the available models, particularly CondInst and YOLACT, utilising InstaBoost data augmentation and many loss functions to build a model for instance segmentation on various sea life. Currently this project is not available on GitHub.
