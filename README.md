**wanony/wanony** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Iâ€™m currently working on:
-  [Joy](https://github.com/wanony/JoyBot), an open source discord bot using the [nextcord](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord) library and MySQL/MariaDB. This is being actively maintained while I work on the following rework.
- [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) based project that was related to my final year university project. Utilised many of the available models, particularly CondInst and YOLACT, utilising InstaBoost data augmentation and many loss functions to build a model for instance segmentation on various sea life. Currently this project is not available on GitHub.
